# What is this about?
We work on all flavors of projects, from startups to well established businesses, from ideas to execution, from rescue-projects (apps on top of Wordpress gone-bad) to best practice platforms. The purpose of these starter kits are to share what we learn with the broader development community - from stacks, boilerplates, etc. We hope it adds value to your projects/products!
