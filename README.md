# What is this and how do I use it?
This starter kit is a combination of best practices, app boilerplates/folder structures, tooling, deployment, do's and don'ts, and more for building apps with React + Redux as the frontend stack. Take the whole thing, take parts of it, make it your own, and let us know if it can be improved!

# Development
## Installing your local development environment
TBD

# Deploying
TBD

# Backend Recommendations
TBD - API first

# How to contribute
If you're not a member of Scalable Path, feel free to fork and submit a pull-request for review/merge - development is a joint effort, and we'd love to have you on board! If you're a member of Scalable Path, hit up @togume to become a direct contributor to the project.

Unless anyone objects, let's use a [Git Reflow approach](https://github.com/reenhanced/gitreflow) (don't think we need `develop` branch for this...), where we create new branches, and pull-request to master.

# Why? What's this about?
We work on all flavors of projects, from startups to well established businesses, from ideas to execution, from rescue-projects (apps on top of Wordpress gone-bad) to best practice platforms. The purpose of these starter kits are to share what we learn with the broader development community - from stacks, boilerplates, etc. We hope it adds value to your projects/products!
